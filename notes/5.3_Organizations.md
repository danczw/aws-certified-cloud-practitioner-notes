# AWS Organizations

- use [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations)Â to consolidate and manage multiple AWS accounts within a central location
- when creating an organization, AWS Organizations automatically creates a *root*, which is the parent container for all the accounts in the organization
- centrally control permissions for the accounts in the organization by using [service control policies (SCPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html)
	- SCPs enable to place restrictions on the AWS services, resources, and individual API actions that users and roles in each account can access
	- consolidated billing is another feature of AWS Organizations
	- can be applied to individual member accounts or organizational units

# Organizational Units

- In AWS Organizations, group accounts into organizational units (OUs) to make it easier to manage accounts with similar business or security requirements
- apply a policy to an OU, all the accounts in the OU automatically inherit the permissions specified in the policy
- By organizing separate accounts into OUs, more easily isolate workloads or applications that have specific security requirements
