# AWS DMS

- AWS Database Migration Service enables to migrate relational databases, nonrelational databases, and other types of data stores
- move data between a source database and a target database
- source and target databases can be of same or different types
- during migration, source database remains operational, reducing downtime for applications that rely on the database

## Further AWS DMS Use Cases

- *Development and test database migrations*: enabling developers to test applications against production data without affecting production users
- *Database consolidation*: combining several databases into a single database
- *Continuous replication*: sending ongoing copies of data to other target sources instead of doing a one-time migration
