# Object Storage

- **object storage**: each object consists of data, metadata, and a key
	- data might be an image, video, text document, or any other type of file
	- Metadata contains information about what the data is, how it is used, the object size, and so on
	- an object’s key is its unique identifier

> **Note**
>
> Recall when modifying a file in block storage, only the pieces that are changed are updated. When a file in object storage is modified, the entire object is updated.

# Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

- [**Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)**](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/): service that provides object-level storage
	- Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets
- upload any type of file to Amazon S3, such as images, videos, text files, and so on.
- Amazon S3 offers unlimited storage space
- maximum file size for an object in Amazon S3 is 5 TB
- when uploading a file to Amazon S3, set permissions to control visibility and access to it
- also use Amazon S3 versioning feature to track changes to objects over time

## Amazon S3 Storage Classes

- with Amazon S3, pay only for what is used
- choose from [a range of storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes) to select a fit for business and cost needs
- when selecting an Amazon S3 storage class, consider these two factors:
	- How often you plan to retrieve your data
	- How available you need your data to be

### S3 Standard
- designed for frequently accessed data
- stores data in a minimum of three Availability Zones
- higher cost than other storage classes intended for infrequently accessed data and archival storage

### S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
- ideal for infrequently accessed data but requires high availability when needed
- stores data in a minimum of three Availability Zones
- similar to Amazon S3 Standard but has a lower storage price and higher retrieval price

### S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
- stores data in a single Availability Zone
- has a lower storage price than Amazon S3 Standard-IA

### S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns
- requires a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object: Amazon S3 monitors objects’ access patterns
- haven’t accessed an object for 30 consecutive days, Amazon S3 automatically moves it to the infrequent access tier, Amazon S3 Standard-IA
- access an object in the infrequent access tier, Amazon S3 automatically moves it to the frequent access tier, Amazon S3 Standard

### S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
- works well for archived data that requires immediate access
- can retrieve objects within a few milliseconds

### S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
- low-cost storage designed for data archiving
- able to retrieve objects within a few minutes to hours

### S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- lowest-cost object storage class ideal for archiving
- able to retrieve objects within 12 hours
- supports long-term retention and digital preservation for data that might be accessed once or twice in a year
- all objects from this storage class are replicated and stored across at least three geographically dispersed Availability Zones

### S3 Outposts
- creates S3 buckets on Amazon S3 Outposts -> delivers object storage to your on-premises AWS Outposts environment
- makes it easier to retrieve, store, and access data on AWS Outposts
