# AWS CloudTrail

- [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) - records API calls for an account
- recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, and more
- view a complete history of user activity and API calls for applications and resourcesÂ 
- Events are typically updated in CloudTrail within 15 minutes after an API call
- filter events by specifying the time and date that an API call occurred, the user who requested the action, the type of resource that was involved in the API call, and more

## CloudTrail Insights

- within CloudTrail, enable [CloudTrail Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.html)
	- optional feature allows CloudTrail to automatically detect unusual API activities in an AWS account

> **Example**
