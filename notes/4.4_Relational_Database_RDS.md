# Amazon RDS Database Engine

- Amazon RDS is available on six database engines, which optimize for memory, performance, or input/output (I/O)

1. Amazon Aurora
2. PostgreSQL
3. MySQL
4. MariaDB
5. Oracle Database
6. Microsoft SQL Server

## Amazon Aurora

- enterprise-class relational database
- compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL relational databases
- up to five times faster than standard MySQL and up to three times faster than standard PostgreSQL
- helps to reduce database cost by reducing unnecessary input/output (I/O) operations, while ensuring resources remain reliable and available
- should be considered if workloads require high availability: replicates six copies of data across three Availability Zones and back-ups to Amazon S3
