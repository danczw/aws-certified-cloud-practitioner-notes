# AWS Free Tier

- enables to begin using certain services without having to worry about incurring costs for the specified period 
- Three types of offers are available: 
	- **Always Free**
		- do not expire and are available to all AWS customers
		- > For example, AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month. Amazon DynamoDB allows 25 GB of free storage per month.
	- **12 Months Free**
		- offers are free for 12 months following initial sign-up date to AWS.
		- > Examples include specific amounts of Amazon S3 Standard Storage, thresholds for monthly hours of Amazon EC2 compute time, and amounts of Amazon CloudFront data transfer out.
	- **Trials**
		- Short-term free trial offers start from the date particular service is activated. The length of each trial might vary by number of days or the amount of usage in the service.
		- > For example, Amazon Inspector offers a 90-day free trial. Amazon Lightsail (a service that enables you to run virtual private servers) offers 750 free hours of usage over a 30-day period.

# Pricing

## Concepts

- **Pay for what you use**
	- For each service, pay exactly the amount of resources that are actually used, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing.
- **Pay less when you reserve**
	- Some services offer reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.
	- > For example, suppose that your company is using Amazon EC2 instances for a workload that needs to run continuously. You might choose to run this workload on Amazon EC2 Instance Savings Plans, because the plan allows you to save up to 72% over the equivalent On-Demand Instance capacity.
- **Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more**
	- Some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage.
	- > For example, the more Amazon S3 storage space you use, the less you pay for it per GB.

## Calculation

- [**AWS Pricing Calculator**](https://calculator.aws/#/) allows to explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of a use cases on AWS
- organize your AWS estimates by groups
- group can reflect how a company is organized, such as providing estimates by cost center
- save estimates and generate a link to share with others
