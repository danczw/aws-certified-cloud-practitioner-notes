# AWS Well-Architected Framework

- helps to understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud
- provides a way to consistently measure your architecture against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement

## Operational Excellence

- ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures
- **design principles for operational excellence** in the cloud include *performing operations as code*, *annotating documentation*, *anticipating failure*, and *frequently making small, reversible changes*

## Security

- ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- when considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices:
	- automate security best practices when possible.
	- apply security at all layers.
	- protect data in transit and at rest.

## Reliability

- ability of a system to do the following:
	- recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
	- dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
	- mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
- reliability includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure

## Performance Efficiency

- ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve
- evaluating performance efficiency of architecture includes experimenting more often, using serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global in minutes

## Cost Optimization

- ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point
- includes adopting a consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership

## Sustainability

- ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required
- to facilitate good design for sustainability:
	- understand your impact
	- establish sustainability goals
	- maximize utilization
	- anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
	- use managed services
	- reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
