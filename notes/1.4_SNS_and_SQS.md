# Messaging and Queuing

## Monolithic Applications
- Applications are made of multiple components
- Components communicate with each other to transmit data, fulfill requests, and keep the application running
	- Suppose an application with tightly coupled components.
	- These components might include databases, servers, the user interface, business logic, and so on
	- This type of architecture can be considered a **monolithic application**. 
- In this approach to application architecture, if a single component fails, other components fail, and possibly the entire application fails.

## Microservices

- To help maintain application availability when a single component fails, you can design your application through a **microservices** approach.
	- In a microservices approach, application components are loosely coupled
	- In this case, if a single component fails, the other components continue to work because they are communicating with each other
	- The loose coupling prevents the entire application from failing. 
- When designing applications on AWS, optionally take a microservices approach with services and components that fulfill different functions
- Two services facilitate application integration: *Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)*_ and *Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)*
- **Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)** is a publish/subscribe service
	- Using Amazon SNS topics, a publisher publishes messages to subscribers
	- Similar to the coffee shop; the cashier provides coffee orders to the barista who makes the drinks.
	- In Amazon SNS, subscribers can be web servers, email addresses, AWS Lambda functions, or several other options.
- **Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)** is a message queuing service
	- Using Amazon SQS: send, store, and receive messages between software components, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available
	- In Amazon SQS, an application sends messages into a queue
	- A user or service retrieves a message from the queue, processes it, and then deletes it from the queue.
