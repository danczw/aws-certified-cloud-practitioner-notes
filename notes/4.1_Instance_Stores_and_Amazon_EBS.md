# Instance Stores

- Block-level storage volumes behave like physical hard drives
- [**instance store**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html) provides temporary block-level storage for an Amazon EC2 instance
	- instance store is disk storage that is physically attached to the host computer for an EC2 instance, and therefore has the same lifespan as the instance
	- when the instance is terminated, any data in the instance store is lost

> **Info**
>
> Amazon EC2 instances are virtual servers. If you start an instance from a stopped state, the instance might start on another host, where the previously used instance store volume does not exist. Therefore, AWS recommends instance stores for use cases that involve temporary data that you do not need in the long term.

- [**Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)**](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs) is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that can be used with Amazon EC2 instances
	- if Amazon EC2 instance is stop or terminate, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available
- to create EBS volume, define configuration (such as volume size and type) and provision it
- after EBS volume is created, it can be attached to Amazon EC2 instance
- because EBS volumes are for data that needs to persist, itâ€™s important to back up the data
- take incremental backups of EBS volumes by creating Amazon EBS snapshots.

- [**EBS snapshot**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html) is an incremental backup
- the first backup taken of a volume copies all the data
- for subsequent backups, only the blocks of data that have changed since the most recent snapshot are saved
- incremental backups are different from full backups
	- full backups: all the data in a storage volume copies each time a backup occurs
	- full backup includes data that has not changed since the most recent backup
