# Region Selection

When determining the right Region for services, data, and applications, consider the following four business factors.

- **Compliance with Data Governance and Legal Requirements**
	- Depending on company and location, data might need to run out of specific areas
	- For example, if company requires all of its data to reside within the boundaries of the UK, choose the London Region.
- **Proximity to customers**
	- Selecting a Region that is close to relevant customers will help to get content to them faster
	- For example, company is based in Washington, DC, and many of its customers live in Singapore. Consider running infrastructure in the Northern Virginia Region to be close to company headquarters, and run applications from the Singapore Region.
- **Available Services within a Region**
	- Sometimes, the closest Region might not have all the features that are needed to offer to customers.
	- AWS is frequently innovating by creating new services and expanding on features within existing services.
	- However, making new services available around the world sometimes requires AWS to build out physical hardware one Region at a time.
- **Pricing**
	- Suppose running applications in both the United States and Brazil is considered.
	- The way Brazil’s tax structure is set up, it might cost 50% more to run the same workload out of the São Paulo Region compared to the Oregon Region.
	- the cost of services can vary from Region to Region.

# Availability Zones

- **Availability Zone**: a single data center or a group of data centers within a Region
	- are located tens of miles apart from each other
	- close enough to have low latency (the time between when content requested and received) between Availability Zones, but far enough that if a disaster occurs in one part of the Region, they are distant enough to reduce the chance that multiple Availability Zones are affected
