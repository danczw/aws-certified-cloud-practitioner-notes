# File Storage

- **file storage**: multiple clients (such as users, applications, servers, and so on) can access data that is stored in shared file folders
- a storage server uses block storage with a local file system to organize files
- clients access data through file paths
- compared to block storage and object storage, file storage is ideal for use cases in which a large number of services and resources need to access the same data at the same time
- [**Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)**](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) is a scalable file system used with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources
	- as files are added and removed, Amazon EFS grows and shrinks automatically
	- can scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications

# Comparing EBS to EFS

| EBS | EFS |
| ----| ---- |
| stores data in single Availability Zone | stores data in and across multiple Availability Zones |
| Attaching EBS to EC2, both must be in the same Availability Zone | access data concurrently form all Availability Zones in the Region where a file system is located |
| | on-premise servers can access Amazon EFS using AWS Direct Connect |
