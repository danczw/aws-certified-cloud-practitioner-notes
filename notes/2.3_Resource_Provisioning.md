# Interact with AWS Services

## AWS Management Console

- web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services
- quickly access recently used services and search for other services by name, keyword, or acronym
- includes wizards and automated workflows that can simplify the process of completing tasks
- use the AWS Console mobile application to perform tasks such as monitoring resources, viewing alarms, and accessing billing information
- Multiple identities can stay logged into the AWS Console mobile app at the same time

## AWS CLI

- To save time when making API requests, use the **AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)**
- enables to control multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool
- available for users on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- automate actions that your services and applications perform through scripts

## Software Development Kits

- Another option for accessing and managing AWS services is the **software development kits (SDKs)**
- make it easier to use AWS services through an API designed for various programming languages or platforms
- enable to use AWS services with existing applications or create entirely new applications that will run on AWS
- AWS provides documentation and sample code for each supported programming language.
- Supported programming languages include C++, Java, .NET, and more.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk

- provide code and configuration settings, and Elastic Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:
	- Adjust capacity
	- Load balancing
	- Automatic scaling
	- Application health monitoring

## AWS CloudFormation

- **infrastructure as code**: build an environment by writing lines of code instead of using the AWS Management Console to individually provision resources
- provisions resources in a safe, repeatable manner, enabling to frequently build infrastructure and applications without having to perform manual actions
- It determines the right operations to perform when managing a stack and rolls back changes automatically if it detects errors

## AWS Outposts

- extend AWS infrastructure and services to your on-premises data centers
