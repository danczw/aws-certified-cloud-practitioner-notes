# Innovation with AWS

- properly equipped to drive innovation in the cloud if you can clearly articulate the following conditions: 
	- The current state
	- The desired state
	- The problems you are trying to solve

## Serverless Application

- **serverless** refers to applications that don’t require you to provision, maintain, or administer servers
- don’t need to worry about fault tolerance or availability
- AWS handles these capabilities for you.
- *AWS Lambda* is an example of a service that can be used to run serverless applications
- design architecture to trigger Lambda functions to run code, thereby bypassing the need to manage a fleet of servers
- building architecture with serverless applications enables developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers

## Artificial Intelligence

- AWS offers a variety of services powered by **artificial intelligence (AI)**. 
- for example, perform the following tasks:
	- convert speech to text with *Amazon Transcribe*
	- discover patterns in text with *Amazon Comprehend*
	- identify potentially fraudulent online activities with *Amazon Fraud Detector*
	- build voice and text chatbots with *Amazon Lex*

## Machine Learning

- traditional **machine learning (ML)** development is complex, expensive, time consuming, and error prone
- use *Amazon SageMaker* to remove the difficult work from the process and be empowered to build, train, and deploy ML models quickly
- use ML to analyze data, solve complex problems, and predict outcomes before they happen
