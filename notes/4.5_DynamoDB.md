# Nonrelational Databases

- sometimes referred to as "NoSQL databases", because they use structures other than rows and columns to organize data
- one type of structural approach for nonrelational databases is key-value pairs
	- data is organized into items (keys), and items have attributes (values)
	- think of attributes as being different features of the data
	- in key-value database, adding and removing attributes from items at any time
	- not every item has to have the same attributes

# Amazon DynamoDB

- a key-value database service
- delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale
- **serverless**:
	- user does not need to provision, patch, or manage servers
	- user does not need to install, maintain, or operate software
- **automatic scaling**:
	- as size of database shrinks or grows, DynamoDB automatically scales to adjust for changes in capacity while maintaining consistent performance
	- suitable for use cases that require high performance while scaling
- PB size potential and granular API access
